<br/>
A recreation of a simple calculator using Verilog. It serves as a means to both ease back into Verilog and show off the combination of everything learned over the years. And high-level approach to this project is discussed in the Project Proposal file.

<b>Milestone 1:</b>
<ul style="margin-top:0px">
    <li>The intention was to get the overall calculator structure down then work on the operations one by one. Successful, but a bit slow moving in that Verilog is rusty for all members. Anticipation is that the process will become faster as the project progresses.</li>
    <li>Began the implementation of the ALU with a basic structure - have it set up that it will hit case statements and do something. Untested, however.</li>
    <li>Concerns:
        <ul style="margin-top:0px">
            <li>What kind of FPGA does the stockroom have available for us to borrow?</li>
            <li>How to comminucate with the FPGA? It sounds like there will be some kind of protocol to do so (same with any other potential peripherals).</li>
            <li>Both the circuit and the FPGA will have their own power source--how will that affect their communcation?</li>
            <li>Can the FPGA support upwards to a 16-bit output? Likewise, how to get an input from simple buttons on the FPGA that is more than one digit?</li>
            <li>What would be the best way to create a negative number and check for it?</li>
            <li>Will the calculator only accept 2 operand operations?</li>
            <li>Will it have the ability to take the previous result and perform an operation on it?</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
